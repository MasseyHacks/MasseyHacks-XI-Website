<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1" style="padding-top:10vh;"><strong>TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an MLH Member Event, if the event itself creates an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with an MLH representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Major League Hacking (MLH) stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, and veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but are not limited to sharing sexual images, violent depictions, vulgar language, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, MLH staff, and anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MLH may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact MLH using the reporting procedures defined below.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">MLH representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, hackathon-related social events, hackathon-supplied transportation, and online interactions related to the event.</p>
